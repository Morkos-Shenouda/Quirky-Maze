Overview
This project is an interactive maze game built with Python and Pygame, using a quantum-inspired random number generator to add unpredictability. Players navigate a maze with the goal of "catching" a moving button to claim their reward. The maze is generated using a unique traversal method that differs from traditional algorithms like BFS or DFS, providing a fresh and challenging experience.

Key Features
Unique Maze Generation: The maze is generated with an innovative traversal algorithm, offering a distinctive structure and pathing from standard BFS or DFS-based mazes.
Quantum Randomness: Quantum-inspired randomness via Qiskit determines the button's unpredictable movements.
Moving Button Challenge: Players must catch a randomly moving button, adding a layer of excitement and difficulty.
Password-Protected Rewards: After catching the button, players enter a password to claim a virtual pile of chocolates.
Smooth Visual Effects: The background smoothly transitions colors, creating an engaging visual experience.
