Overview
This project is an interactive maze game built with Python and Pygame, using a quantum-inspired random number generator to add unpredictability. Players navigate a maze with the goal of "catching" a moving button to claim their reward. The maze is generated using a unique traversal method that differs from traditional algorithms like BFS or DFS, providing a fresh and challenging experience.

Key Features:
Unique maze generation with an innovative traversal algorithm.
Quantum-inspired randomness for button movement.
Moving button challenge and password-protected rewards.
Smooth background color transitions.
